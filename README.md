Thought for 2m 23s
Nice — I’ll answer every question from the uploaded assignment step-by-step, in beginner-friendly language. I used your uploaded file Q1.docx as the source. 
Q1


Q1 — SRS for Hospital Management System (10 marks total)
I’ll give each subpart with short, clear points and tiny explanations so you can copy/learn.

a) Abstract (4M) — (what, why, who)
What it is (1–2 lines):
Hospital Management System (HMS) is a web application that automates patient, staff, clinical and financial workflows — appointments, records (EMR), billing, labs, pharmacy, inventory and reports.

Why it’s needed (1–2 lines):
Reduces manual paperwork, speeds up patient service, improves data accuracy, and helps administrators and clinicians access up-to-date patient information.

Who uses it (1 line):
Hospital admin, doctors, nurses, lab technicians, pharmacists, billing staff, and patients (portal).

(Short example abstract you can paste into your answer)

The Hospital Management System (HMS) is a secure, role-based web application to manage patient records, appointments, clinical workflows, inventory and billing. It improves task automation, reduces paperwork and supports real-time reporting for administrators and clinicians.

b) Functional Requirements (2M) — (what the system must DO)
Write 6–8 concise FRs (each 0.25–0.33 marks roughly):

Patient management: create/read/update/delete patient profiles (demographics, history).

Appointment scheduling: book, reschedule, cancel appointments; doctor calendar view.

Clinical records (EMR): record diagnoses, prescriptions, vitals, lab orders/results.

Billing & payments: generate invoices, process payments, apply insurance claims.

Pharmacy & inventory: manage stock, issue medicines, low-stock alerts.

User/role management: roles (admin, doctor, nurse, lab, pharmacist, patient) with access control.

Reporting: daily revenue, patient visits, medicine usage reports.

Notifications: appointment reminders and result notifications (email/SMS).

(Short explanation: each FR is a single feature the system must perform.)

c) Non-Functional Requirements (2M) — (system qualities)
Security & Privacy: Authentication (password + optional 2FA), RBAC, encryption at rest & in transit (HTTPS), audit logs, HIPAA/GDPR compliance if applicable.

Performance: Typical page load < 2s for main screens; API responses < 300ms for DB reads under normal load.

Availability & Reliability: 99.5% uptime target, automated backups (daily) and disaster recovery.

Scalability & Maintainability: Modular code (services), horizontal scaling for web/API, configuration via environment variables.

Usability: Intuitive UI, accessible forms, mobile-friendly pages for doctors/nurses.

Logging & Monitoring: Central logs, alerts for failures, health checks.

d) Introduction & Overview (2M)
Purpose: Describe the problem the HMS solves — digitize hospital workflows, reduce errors, speed patient flow.
Scope: Hospital outpatient/inpatient modules, EMR, billing, pharmacy. (What’s in/out: e.g., not covering advanced imaging viewer).
Stakeholders: Hospital admin, medical staff, patients, IT team.
System Context: Web frontend (React/HTML), backend API (Node/Java/Python), database (MongoDB/MySQL), optional integration with third-party labs and payment gateways.
High-level architecture: Client ←→ REST APIs ←→ DB + External services (SMS/email, payment, lab).

Q2 — Maven Java Application Development (30M)
I’ll give commands you run, explain why, and provide corrected pom.xml snippets. I can’t run commands in your computer, so follow these exact steps in your terminal.

1) Download repo & list files (3M)
Commands:

# clone (do this in a folder you want)
git clone https://github.com/Kumbhambargavi75/HospitalMgmtSystem.git
cd HospitalMgmtSystem

# list files (Linux/macOS)
ls -la

# or Windows (PowerShell)
dir
What you’ll see: top-level folders like src/, pom.xml, README.md, maybe webapp/ etc. If ls shows pom.xml, you’re in the right place.

2) After git pull ... pom.xml has an error — why? (3M)
Common reason (and likely the one in your repo): malformed XML tags or mismatched tag names. In your doc you have <finalname> ... </finalName> — note the different cases (finalname vs finalName) or an incorrect closing tag. XML is case-sensitive: opening and closing tags must match exactly.

How it fails: Maven/XML parser stops with “The element type "finalname" must be terminated by the matching end-tag "</finalname>"” or similar.

Fix: edit pom.xml and correct the tag (example below).

3) Add dependency servlet-api 2.5 (3M)
Add this (but see note after):

<dependency>
  <groupId>javax.servlet</groupId>
  <artifactId>servlet-api</artifactId>
  <version>2.5</version>
  <scope>provided</scope>  <!-- container (Tomcat) will provide it -->
</dependency>
Why scope=provided? The servlet container (Tomcat, Jetty) already supplies the servlet classes at runtime; you need them only to compile. See discussion of provided scope. 
maven.apache.org

(Note: if your target container supports Servlet 4.0, prefer javax.servlet:javax.servlet-api:4.0.1 or jakarta.servlet-api instead — I cover 4.0 below.)

Reference for servlet 2.5 coordinates: Maven Central. 
Maven Repository

4) Building with JDK 21 fails — why? How to fix in pom.xml? (2M)
Why failure: older maven-compiler-plugin or wrong compiler properties may not accept 21 as valid --release value; also the system running Maven might be using an older JDK/JRE. The common error is Invalid target release: 21 or similar. 
TecAdmin

Fix in pom.xml: set modern compiler plugin and use <release>21</release> (recommended) or properties. Example:

<properties>
  <maven.compiler.release>21</maven.compiler.release>
  <maven.compiler.plugin.version>3.11.0</maven.compiler.plugin.version>
</properties>

<build>
  <plugins>
    <plugin>
      <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
      <artifactId>maven-compiler-plugin</artifactId>
      <version>${maven.compiler.plugin.version}</version>
      <configuration>
        <release>${maven.compiler.release}</release>
      </configuration>
    </plugin>
    ...
  </plugins>
</build>
Also make sure JAVA_HOME points to JDK 21 and mvn -v shows Java 21. (I show how to check later.)

Useful Apache docs about using --release with maven-compiler-plugin. 
maven.apache.org

5) junit:4.12 dependency — what will Maven do? How to solve? (3M)
Given this block:

<dependency>
  <groupId>junit</groupId>
  <artifactId>junit</artifactId>
  <version>4.12</version>
</dependency>
Maven will: treat it as a compile dependency (default) and include it on the project classpath and potentially package it — which is not what you want for a test framework.

Fix: mark JUnit as test-scope:

<dependency>
  <groupId>junit</groupId>
  <artifactId>junit</artifactId>
  <version>4.13.2</version>
  <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>
Better option: use JUnit 5 (JUnit Jupiter) for new projects — then configure maven-surefire-plugin to run JUnit5. For now, simple fix: add <scope>test</scope>.

6) Generated file name hospitalmgmt-system-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar — how to get HospitalMgmtSystem.jar? (3M)
Add <finalName> inside <build>:

<build>
  <finalName>HospitalMgmtSystem</finalName>
  ...
</build>
When you run mvn package the artifact will be target/HospitalMgmtSystem.war (or .jar depending on packaging).

7) Add Java Servlet-API 4.0.0-b01 central dependency (2M)
Add (and scope provided):

<dependency>
  <groupId>javax.servlet</groupId>
  <artifactId>javax.servlet-api</artifactId>
  <version>4.0.0-b01</version>
  <scope>provided</scope>
</dependency>
This artifact exists on Maven Central (you can use 4.0.1 as more recent stable version). Example source: Maven Central listing for javax.servlet-api 4.0.0-b01. 
Maven Repository
+1

Important: Do not keep both servlet 2.5 and servlet 4.0 in compile scope — pick the version compatible with your Tomcat.

8) Update maven-war-plugin section completely (and sample plugin config)
A minimal safe configuration:

<plugin>
  <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
  <artifactId>maven-war-plugin</artifactId>
  <version>3.3.2</version> <!-- pick a recent version -->
  <configuration>
    <!-- if you don't have WEB-INF/web.xml set to false for newer servlet API -->
    <failOnMissingWebXml>false</failOnMissingWebXml>
    <!-- warName defaults to ${project.build.finalName} -->
  </configuration>
</plugin>

9) Will Maven still build? Issues during testing? (2M)
Will it build? Usually yes — if JAVA_HOME points to a correct JDK, plugin versions are compatible with Java 21, and you fixed XML errors.

Possible test/runtime issues:

Tests may fail if JUnit scope is wrong or incompatible with surefire plugin version.

If servlet API is provided and you run the app outside a container (e.g., java -jar), servlet classes won’t be present — you must deploy to Tomcat or use an embedded server.

If you run Maven with a JRE instead of a JDK, compilation or mvn install may fail. See next item.

10) Error: ... environment where you are running on a JRE rather than a JDK (2M)
What it means: Maven needs a JDK (javac compiler) for compile/javadoc/signing tasks. If JAVA_HOME points to a JRE (no javac), Maven cannot compile. 
Baeldung on Kotlin

How to fix (commands):

# Check maven + java versions
mvn -v
# It should show: Java version: 21, vendor: ... and Java home pointing to JDK path.

# Check javac
$JAVA_HOME/bin/javac -version
# or
javac -version
If it’s wrong, install JDK 21 and set JAVA_HOME to JDK folder, then re-run mvn clean package.

11) Is <finalname>HospitalMgmt8080/hodSystem</finalName> wrong? Fix it (2M)
Problems:

Tag mismatch (finalname != finalName) → XML error.

finalName should not contain / (slash). Use a safe name (letters, numbers, hyphen/underscore).

Fix:

<build>
  <finalName>HospitalMgmt8080-hodSystem</finalName>
</build>
12) packaging is jar but deployment targets Tomcat — will it run? (2M)
No. Tomcat expects a WAR file for a webapp. If your app is a standard webapp, set:

<packaging>war</packaging>
(If you use Spring Boot with an embedded server, jar is fine — but plain Tomcat requires war.)

13) <url>http://maven.java.org/1.2<url> — what’s wrong & what is <url> for? (3M)
What's wrong: the closing tag is incorrect (you opened <url> but didn’t close properly). It should be </url>. Also the URL string looks like an invalid project site.

Purpose of <url>: points to the project's website or home page; it’s purely informational/helpful for users and Maven site generation. Use it like:

<url>https://github.com/<your-account>/HospitalMgmtSystem</url>

14) Check complete pom.xml & push to author’s account — steps (3M)
Edit & commit locally:

# fix pom.xml in an editor
git add pom.xml
git commit -m "Fix pom.xml: correct tags, set Java 21, add servlet api provided, set packaging=war, set finalName"
Push to remote (if you have push rights):

# push to the branch you're working on
git push origin main
# or if using another branch
git push -u origin fix/pom
If you don’t have push rights to the author’s repo, fork the repository on GitHub, push your branch to your fork and create a Pull Request.

Q3 — Git & GitHub Integration (30M)
Short, simple commands + explanation.

Discard local changes made to one file (unstaged):

# old style
git checkout -- path/to/file

# new style (recommended)
git restore path/to/file
This restores the file to the last committed state.

I committed but forgot a commit message — how to add/change it?

# change the last commit message (amend)
git commit --amend -m "Correct commit message"
Use only if the commit was local and not yet pushed. If you already pushed, prefer git revert + new commit or coordinate with team.

View commit history in readable form:

git log --oneline --graph --decorate --all
Shows a compact, visual history.

Create & switch to branch feature/patient:

git checkout -b feature/patient
Creates and moves you to the new branch.

Upload local commits to remote:

# push current branch
git push

# or explicitly
git push origin feature/patient
See all branches (local + remote):

git branch -a
On a feature branch, bring in changes from main:

# safer: fetch then merge
git fetch origin
git merge origin/main

# alternative: rebase (rewrites history, but keeps linear)
git fetch origin
git rebase origin/main
Use merge if you’re new; rebase gives a linear history but be careful with shared branches.

Push for the first time and set upstream tracking:

git push -u origin feature/patient
-u sets the branch’s remote tracking so future git push works without arguments.

You cloned repo; check remote updates and sync:

git fetch origin
git status
git pull   # fetch+merge from current upstream
To see what’s different between local and remote:

git log --oneline HEAD..origin/main
Ignore local logs of changed repo? Bring branch up to date without losing local changes:
(I think you mean “I have local uncommitted changes but want to update from remote.”)

# save local changes temporarily
git stash save "WIP: my local changes"

# update branch
git pull --rebase origin main   # or git fetch && git merge origin/main

# reapply local changes
git stash pop
git stash is your friend when you want to temporarily shelve changes.

Delete a remote branch (you no longer need local branch):

# delete remote branch
git push origin --delete feature/branch-name

# delete local branch
git branch -d feature/branch-name
Apply a patch file provided by team and include in history:

# method A: plain patch
git apply myfix.patch
git add .
git commit -m "Apply patch: myfix"

# method B: if patch is in mbox mailbox format
git am myfix.mbox
git apply updates working tree; then you commit. git am applies email formatted patches preserving author/date.

Q4 — Docker Containerization (20M)
I’ll give a Dockerfile for a WAR deployed to Tomcat, and all CLI commands you need.

Example Dockerfile (use when you have a WAR)
Create file Dockerfile:

# Use official Tomcat image (has Tomcat + JRE/JDK depending on tag)
FROM tomcat:9-jdk11-openjdk

# Remove default webapps to avoid duplicate ROOT
RUN rm -rf /usr/local/tomcat/webapps/*

# Copy your WAR produced by mvn package into Tomcat webapps as ROOT.war
# (Assuming you built target/HospitalMgmtSystem.war)
COPY target/HospitalMgmtSystem.war /usr/local/tomcat/webapps/ROOT.war

# Expose Tomcat HTTP port
EXPOSE 8080

# Start Tomcat (entrypoint already set in base image)
CMD ["catalina.sh", "run"]
(If you need Java 21 support, pick a Tomcat base image that includes a JDK 21 runtime or build an image from an OpenJDK 21 base and install Tomcat.)

CLI commands (step-by-step)
Build the Docker image named hospital-mgmt:

docker build -t hospital-mgmt:latest .
List available Docker images:

docker images
Run container mapping container port 8080 → host 9090:

docker run -d --name hospital-instance -p 9090:8080 hospital-mgmt:latest
# then browse to http://localhost:9090
Pull MongoDB image & run container, then list running containers:

docker pull mongo:latest
docker run -d --name mongodb -p 27017:27017 mongo:latest
docker ps   # lists running containers
# verify: mongo accessible on localhost:27017 (use a Mongo client or `mongo` shell)
Tag and push image to Docker Hub (your account your-username):

# tag
docker tag hospital-mgmt:latest your-username/cms:latest

# login (interactive)
docker login

# push
docker push your-username/cms:latest
Forgot to expose port mapping — how to fix (stop and rerun):

# find container id or name
docker ps

# stop & remove current container
docker stop hospital-instance
docker rm hospital-instance

# re-run with port mapping
docker run -d --name hospital-instance -p 9090:8080 your-username/cms:latest
Inspect logs to debug:

docker logs -f hospital-instance
Open shell inside running container:

docker exec -it hospital-instance /bin/bash
# if bash not available, try /bin/sh
View running processes in the container:

docker top hospital-instance
# or inside container
docker exec hospital-instance ps aux
Push image already on your machine to Docker Hub: (see step 5) — docker tag then docker push.

Q5 — Docker Compose (10M)
Write docker-compose.yml to run your app + MongoDB. The question asks to use the image you pushed and run it on 7079:8080.

docker-compose.yml (example)
version: "3.8"

services:
  app:
    image: your-username/cms:latest   # image you pushed to Docker Hub
    container_name: campusmgmt_app
    ports:
      - "7079:8080"
    depends_on:
      - mongo
    environment:
      - MONGO_URL=mongodb://mongo:27017
    restart: unless-stopped

  mongo:
    image: mongo:latest
    container_name: campusmgmt_mongo
    ports:
      - "27017:27017"
    volumes:
      - mongo-data:/data/db
    restart: unless-stopped

volumes:
  mongo-data:
How to run:

# start in detached mode
docker-compose up -d

# stop and remove
docker-compose down
Explanation:

app uses your public Docker Hub image and maps host 7079 → container 8080.

mongo runs MongoDB and stores data in a volume.

depends_on ensures mongo starts before app (but does not wait for DB readiness — you might add a healthcheck in production).

Quick checklist & helpful commands (noob friendly)
Check Java and Maven:

java -version
javac -version
mvn -v
Build project:

mvn clean package
If Invalid target release: 21, update maven-compiler-plugin and maven.compiler.release in pom.xml. 
TecAdmin
maven.apache.org

If Maven complains “perhaps you are running on a JRE rather than a JDK”, set JAVA_HOME to a JDK. 
Baeldung on Kotlin

If you want, I can:

(A) produce a ready-to-paste pom.xml with exact groupId/artifactId filled from the repo (I’d need the repo’s existing pom.xml content — you can paste it here), or

(B) walk you through the exact terminal output you’ll see when you run mvn -v, mvn clean package, docker build, etc.

But since you asked for everything now, I included full explanations, corrected pom example, all git & docker commands, and the docker-compose file. If anything is long or confusing, tell me which small part you want me to expand and I’ll explain step-by-step in plain language.

Building with JDK 21 fails — why? How to fix in `pom.xml`? (2M)

to know whether it failed or not first we need to run..how to run?
ChatGPT said:
Got it 👍 You’re asking how to actually run Maven so you can see whether it fails with JDK 21 or not. Let me break it down step by step (beginner-friendly):

1. Open a terminal in your project folder
Windows (PowerShell or CMD):

cd path\to\HospitalMgmtSystem
Linux/Mac:

cd /path/to/HospitalMgmtSystem
Make sure this folder contains your pom.xml.

2. Run Maven build commands
The basic command is:

mvn clean package
clean → deletes the old build files (in target/ folder).

package → compiles, runs tests, and packages the app into a .jar or .war file.

3. What to check
If everything works, you’ll see BUILD SUCCESS at the end.

If something is wrong (e.g., invalid <release>21</release>), you’ll see BUILD FAILURE with an error message.

4. Extra useful commands
Check Maven version and Java version it’s using:

mvn -v
Make sure it says Java 21 (not JRE only, it should be JDK).

Run without packaging (just compile):

mvn compile
Run tests:

mvn test
✅ So, to “know whether it failed or not,” just go into your project folder and run:

mvn clean package
Then look for BUILD SUCCESS or BUILD FAILURE in the output.

Do you want me to also show you a sample output (like how the console looks if it fails with JDK 21), so you’ll know what to expect?

You said:
so we need keep on updating the pom.xml until we get build success after running mvn clean package
ChatGPT said:
Yes 🙂, you understood it correctly. That’s exactly the process when working with Maven projects.

Here’s how it usually goes step by step:

🔄 Iterative process
Start with the existing pom.xml.

Run:

mvn clean package
If you see BUILD SUCCESS ✅, you’re done.

If you see BUILD FAILURE ❌, read the error carefully:

It may say wrong tag in pom.xml → fix the tag.

It may say dependency missing or wrong version → update dependency block.

It may say compiler issue with Java 21 → update <maven-compiler-plugin> section.

It may say packaging type mismatch → change <packaging> to war or jar.

After each fix → run mvn clean package again.

Repeat until it builds successfully.

⚡ Why this happens
Maven is very strict: if pom.xml has even a small mistake (wrong tag, wrong case, missing scope, bad plugin version), build will fail.

Updating the pom.xml until BUILD SUCCESS is the normal workflow for developers.

✅ What “done” looks like
When you finally fix everything, Maven ends with:

[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS
[INFO] Total time:  4.123 s
[INFO] Finished at: 2025-09-09T20:10:35+05:30
[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------
And your packaged file appears in the target/ folder (e.g., HospitalMgmtSystem.war or .jar).

👉 Do you want me to simulate a failure and the exact error text (like what Maven prints if <finalName> is wrong or if Java 21 causes issues), so you’ll know how to recognize them?

ChatGPT said:
Perfect 👍 Let’s solve this question step by step (like an exam answer). I’ll refer to the given repo link (HospitalMgmtSystem) and assume Maven builds a WAR file (since it’s a web app that runs on Tomcat).

🐳 a) Dockerfile for Maven Project (WAR deployment on Tomcat)
Create a file named Dockerfile in the project root:

# Use official Tomcat base image (includes JDK + Tomcat)
FROM tomcat:9-jdk11-openjdk

# Remove default webapps to avoid conflicts
RUN rm -rf /usr/local/tomcat/webapps/*

# Copy the WAR file built by Maven into Tomcat webapps as ROOT.war
COPY target/HospitalMgmtSystem.war /usr/local/tomcat/webapps/ROOT.war

# Expose Tomcat port
EXPOSE 8080

# Start Tomcat
CMD ["catalina.sh", "run"]
👉 Explanation:

FROM tomcat:9-jdk11-openjdk → base image with Tomcat + JDK.

COPY target/HospitalMgmtSystem.war ... → places your app in Tomcat’s webapps folder.

EXPOSE 8080 → tells Docker the container listens on port 8080.

CMD ["catalina.sh", "run"] → starts Tomcat.

🐳 b) CLI Commands
1. Build the Docker image with the name hospital-mgmt
docker build -t hospital-mgmt:latest .
-t → tag (name: hospital-mgmt, tag: latest).

. → build context is the current folder (where Dockerfile is).

2. List all available Docker images
docker images
Shows all local images, including hospital-mgmt.

3. Run the container mapping container port 8080 → host port 9090
docker run -d --name hospital-container -p 9090:8080 hospital-mgmt:latest
-d → detached (runs in background).

--name hospital-container → easy name for the container.

-p 9090:8080 → maps host port 9090 to container port 8080.

Access app at: http://localhost:9090.

4. Pull MongoDB image, run container, list containers, verify
# Pull image
docker pull mongo:latest

# Run MongoDB container
docker run -d --name mongodb -p 27017:27017 mongo:latest

# List running containers
docker ps

# Verify MongoDB is accessible
# (If Mongo shell installed)
mongo --host localhost --port 27017
27017 is Mongo’s default port.

5. Tag and push image to Docker Hub (your-username/cms)
# Tag the image
docker tag hospital-mgmt:latest your-username/cms:latest

# Login to Docker Hub
docker login

# Push to Docker Hub
docker push your-username/cms:latest
Now it’s public at https://hub.docker.com/r/your-username/cms.

6. Forgot to expose port mapping → fix it
If you forgot -p 9090:8080, stop and rerun:

# Stop and remove wrong container
docker stop hospital-container
docker rm hospital-container

# Run again with port mapping
docker run -d --name hospital-container -p 9090:8080 hospital-mgmt:latest
👉 You cannot add port mapping to a running container — must recreate it.

7. Ensure container runs correctly after restart
docker restart hospital-container
Restart keeps the correct settings (-p 9090:8080) if container was created properly.

8. Inspect logs and debug issue
docker logs -f hospital-container
-f → follows logs in real-time (like tail -f).

9. Push image to Docker Hub (make available publicly)
If not yet pushed:

docker push your-username/cms:latest
If already tagged and pushed → it’s automatically public unless your repo is private on Docker Hub.

10. Open shell inside container
docker exec -it hospital-container /bin/bash
-it → interactive terminal.

/bin/bash (if not available, try /bin/sh).

Lets you browse files inside container.

11. View running processes in container
# Show processes of the container
docker top hospital-container

# Or directly inside container
docker exec hospital-container ps aux
Confirms whether Tomcat is running and your app is deployed.

✅ That’s the full workflow:

Build image.

Run container.

Map ports.

Run MongoDB.

Push to Docker Hub.

Debug using logs + exec.

Do you want me to also write a Docker Compose file (for Tomcat + MongoDB together) so you don’t have to run two separate docker run commands?

You said:
give steps like open doxker desktop like that
ChatGPT said:
Ahh got it 👍 — you want step-by-step “noob-friendly” instructions like “open Docker Desktop” → “click here” → “type this” instead of only CLI. Let me explain both GUI + CLI way so you don’t get lost.

🐳 Step-by-Step Guide to Run Your Maven Project with Docker
1. Install & Open Docker
Install Docker Desktop from Docker official site.

After install, open Docker Desktop.

Make sure it’s running — you’ll see the whale icon 🐳 in system tray.

2. Build Your WAR/JAR with Maven
Open VS Code / IntelliJ / CMD / PowerShell.

Go to your project folder (where pom.xml is):

cd path\to\HospitalMgmtSystem
Run Maven to build:

mvn clean package
If success ✅, your WAR will be in target/HospitalMgmtSystem.war.

3. Write Dockerfile
In your project folder, create a new file Dockerfile (no extension) with:

FROM tomcat:9-jdk11-openjdk
RUN rm -rf /usr/local/tomcat/webapps/*
COPY target/HospitalMgmtSystem.war /usr/local/tomcat/webapps/ROOT.war
EXPOSE 8080
CMD ["catalina.sh", "run"]
Save it.

4. Build Docker Image
CLI method:
Open terminal in the project folder and run:

docker build -t hospital-mgmt:latest .
Docker Desktop GUI method:

Open Docker Desktop.

Go to Images → Build.

Select your project folder (where Dockerfile is).

Enter image name: hospital-mgmt.

Click Build.

5. Check Images
CLI:

docker images
GUI: Open Docker Desktop → Images tab, you should see hospital-mgmt.

6. Run the Container (Expose Port 9090 → 8080)
CLI:

docker run -d --name hospital-container -p 9090:8080 hospital-mgmt:latest
GUI:

Go to Images → hospital-mgmt → Run.

Set container name: hospital-container.

In Optional settings, set Port mapping: Host 9090 → Container 8080.

Click Run.

👉 Open your browser: http://localhost:9090.

7. Add MongoDB
CLI:

docker pull mongo:latest
docker run -d --name mongodb -p 27017:27017 mongo:latest
docker ps
GUI:

Go to Images → search for mongo in Docker Hub.

Click Pull.

After it appears, click Run.

Set name: mongodb.

Port mapping: Host 27017 → Container 27017.

Click Run.

Now MongoDB is running at localhost:27017.

8. Push Image to Docker Hub
CLI:

docker tag hospital-mgmt:latest your-username/cms:latest
docker login
docker push your-username/cms:latest
GUI:

Go to Images → hospital-mgmt → Push to Hub.

Login with your Docker Hub account.

Set repo name: your-username/cms.

Push.

9. Debug Logs
CLI:

docker logs -f hospital-container
GUI:

Go to Containers/Apps → click on your container (hospital-container).

Click Logs tab.

10. Open Shell Inside Container
CLI:

docker exec -it hospital-container /bin/bash
GUI:

Go to Containers/Apps.

Click container → CLI tab → it opens a shell inside container.

11. See Running Processes
CLI:

docker top hospital-container
GUI:

Go to container details → Inspect → check processes.

✅ Now you know both GUI (Docker Desktop) and CLI way.
Usually developers prefer CLI for automation, but GUI is helpful if you’re new.

Do you want me to also create a Docker Compose file for you (so MongoDB + your app run together automatically), and I’ll explain how to run it using Docker Desktop’s GUI?
